# Modules

FARMS builds upon MOOSE to encapsulate common kernels, boundary conditions, etc. to prevent
code duplication.

Current version of FARMS supports Thermal-Mechanical-Fracture coupling only. Therefore dependent MOOSE modules include:

- [Tensor Mechanics](modules/tensor_mechanics/index.md)

Feel free to create an issue on Github to ask for additional modules support.
